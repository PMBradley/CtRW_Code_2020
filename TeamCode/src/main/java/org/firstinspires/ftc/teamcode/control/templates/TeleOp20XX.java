/*
    Welcome to the template TeleOp class!
    To use it just make a copy of this class, and change all appearances of "20XX" with the starting year of the current season
    (for example, for the 2020-2021 season, the class would be named TeleOp2020 and all code within would have to reflect that change).
    It is recommended that somewhere near the top you have a comment block that describes your robot control scheme for easy reference.
    Also, don't forget to remove or comment out the "@Disabled" line, so that it will show up in the list of opmodes on the driver station.


    Happy coding!
